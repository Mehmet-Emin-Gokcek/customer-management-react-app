# Customer Management React App

Check out the Live Demo below. 
https://mehmetgokcek.github.io/customer-management-react-app/


- This React App uses an ASP.NET 5 REST API that I have built to handle basic CRUD operations on the customer object. 

- Customer data persists on an SQL database server. 

- Both REST API and SQL Server run on Azure cloud. 

- You can see live demo of the REST API here https://customermanagementapi2.azurewebsites.net/api/customers

- There is additional documentation of this REST API here https://github.com/mehmetGokcek/CustomerManagementAPI
